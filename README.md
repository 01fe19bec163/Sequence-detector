# Sequence-detector
The sequence detector is designed using the Moore finite state machine. The output of this type of FSM depends only on the current state.
The example considered here is to detect the sequence '1011'. The ouput of the FSM becomes high only when the sequence 1011 is detected, otherwise remains low.
The design also works if the input has overlapping sequence.
The simulation waveform and code are uploaded in this repository.
